## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Erastus Mueke and I am a freshman to the programming industry. I recently joined the International Youth Fellowship training program. I am currently learning computer programming and my main aim is to become a software engineer with interest in learning Frontend and Backend technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems and building efficient, scalable solutions. My goal is to create innovative and user-friendly applications that make a difference. I am looking forward to working on both guided and solo projects.
